# Informed Consent with research participants

A repository of [IF's](https://www.projectsbyif.com/) public user-research files. 

At IF, research is fundamental to our work. We want to ensure that the people we carry out research with are well-informed, comfortable, protected and respected throughout the entirety of their engagement with us. We also want them to enjoy their experience of being involved with research. As a part of this, we make sure that Informed Consent is agreed with every research participant. We have written about [how we undertake user research and use these resources](https://medium.com/writing-by-if/how-we-agree-informed-consent-with-research-participants-1e5d705416df).
